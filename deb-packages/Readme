## To use LinVst

Install the vst's.

The vst's will probably be installed by default to a Wine folder, something like ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Steinberg/VSTPlugins (which is similar to where they are installed on Windows).

It's also possible with most plugins to make a folder and install the windows vst's into it.

Start linvstconvert and select the linvst.so file which is installed in /usr/share/LinVst/xxbit.

Point linvstconvert to the folder containing the windows vst's and hit the Start (Convert) button.

Start up the linux DAW and point it to scan the folder containing the windows vst's.

If new vst plugins are added to a folder, then just run linvstconvert again on that folder.

linvstconvert is installed into /usr/bin

-------------

LinVst made using Debian but will probably run on other distros.

32 bit vst's running under the 64bit LinVst versions need a distros multiarch to be enabled (sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib for Ubuntu/Debian).

A Gtk and commandline utility is included that can automatically batch rename linvst.so to mutiple windows vst dll names that are in a folder/directory.

For Waveform, disable sandbox option for plugins.

For Renoise, choose the sandbox option for plugins.

For Bitwig 2.5 and 3.x, In Settings->Plug-ins choose "Individually" plugin setting and check all of the LinVst plugins.
For Bitwig 2.4.3, In Settings->Plug-ins choose Independent plug-in host process for "Each plug-in" setting and check all of the LinVst plugins.
