## To use LinVst

The vst dll files need to have associated .so files (that have the same name as the vst dll files), so that a Linux DAW can load them.

linvstconvert and linvstconverttree (also handles vst dll files in subdirectories) can produce the associated .so files automatically.

linvstconvert will not convert vst dll's in sub folders and so some plugins might not appear after a daw scan, so if that happens then use linvstconverttree.

linvstconverttree will convert vst dll's in all sub folders.

Start linvstconvert (or linvstconverttree) and select the linvst.so file which is installed in /usr/share/LinVst/xxbit.

Then select the folder containing the vst dll files, and then click on the Convert button.

Then point the DAW to scan that vst folder.

linvstconvert and linvstconverttree are installed in /usr/bin

There are also python scripts that can be used linvstconvert64 for LinVst 64bit only, linvstconvert6432 for LinVst 64bit and 32bit and linvstconvert32 for LinVst 32bit only.

linvstconvertxx "path to vst dll folder/*" (** for subdirectories); Path to vst dll folder is enclosed in quotes.

For example linvstconvertxx "/home/user/vst/*" or linvstconvertxx "/home/user/vst/**" for subdirectories.

-------------

LinVst made using Debian but will probably run on other distros.

32 bit vst's running under the 64bit LinVst versions need a distros multiarch to be enabled (sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib for Ubuntu/Debian).

A Gtk and commandline utility is included that can automatically batch rename linvst.so to mutiple windows vst dll names that are in a folder/directory.

For Waveform, disable sandbox option for plugins.

For Renoise, choose the sandbox option for plugins.

For Bitwig 2.5 and 3.x, In Settings->Plug-ins choose "Individually" plugin setting and check all of the LinVst plugins.
For Bitwig 2.4.3, In Settings->Plug-ins choose Independent plug-in host process for "Each plug-in" setting and check all of the LinVst plugins.
